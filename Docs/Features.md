# Main page
Contains shortcuts to two pages:
- Manage shows
- Manage frames

SARA

# Manage shows
Manage all shows, or shows within a frame if triggered from its interface.
Need to support filtering.

Probably pass a list as an argument when creating it? Will be clean-ish.

SARA

## Show UI
Images, rename, delete, etc...

SARA

## After creating a show
Display a notification that the user can add a show to a frames from the frames menu.
OR provide a menu for the user to pick from the available frames.

SARA

# Manage frames
List of frames with a template:
- Frame image / name
    - Manage shows on this frame...
    - Send a photo
    - Manage frame

Buttons:
- Add frame
- Delete frame

TORI

## Add frame
Enter a parsing code
We will have a list of whitelisted codes that we are considered "correct" ones. Any incorrect ones will throw errors.

TORI

## Send a photo
OPTIONAL: it's a duplicated ability so we can skip it
A simple list of frames to send a photo to. Clicking one frame will redirect to appropriate frame -> add image...

Let's not do it for now! As it's optional

NOBODY

## Manage frame
Adjust:
- Name
- Brightness
- Widgets...
